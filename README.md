# RL_Final_Project
Adversarial example for Reinorcement Learning

## Train a RL model for pong atari game
Deep Q-Learning. **Details**

## Environment
* Since the environment is not direvtly available in the default OpenAI Gym package, wrappers are required to use the ```PongDeterministic-v4``` environment.
* The necessary wrappers can be downloaded from the [OpenAI baseline repository.](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/common)

## To-Do
* Get the final trained model and upload it to repo
* Add output video gif for trained model
* Introduce adversity through FGSM
* Get the video output and compare
* Elaborate adversarial attack and FGSM
